                <h2>A history of the Mad-lib</h2>
             <p>Mad Libs is a word game created in 1953 by Leonard Stern and Roger Price, two American writers and humorists. The idea for Mad Libs originated when Stern was writing for a television show and asked a friend to supply an adjective for a script he was working on. The suggestion was hilariously inappropriate, sparking the concept of filling in blanks with random words for comedic effect.

                The first Mad Libs book was published in 1958, featuring a collection of stories with key words replaced by blanks for players to fill in. The name "Mad Libs" came from an offhand comment overheard by Price, where someone mentioned a “mad ad-lib.” Stern and Price decided it was the perfect name for their game.
                
                Mad Libs gained popularity as a party game, especially for children and families, because of its simplicity and humor. Over the decades, it expanded into themed editions, apps, and even classroom tools to teach parts of speech. Today, it remains a beloved pastime, blending language, creativity, and humor.</p></div>
